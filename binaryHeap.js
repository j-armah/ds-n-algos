/*

MaxBinaryHeap 
-  Parent nodes always larger than child nodes
- Each parents has at most two child nodes
- Parent is greater than thhe children, but no guarantee between siblings
- Binary heap is compact as possible, all children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first


MinBinaryHeap 
- Parent nodes always smaller than child nodes


----------------------------------------------------
****
for any index n
left child is stored at index 2n + 1
right child at 2n + 2
